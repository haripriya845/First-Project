        <h2>TANGLED</h2>
        <p>**Tangled** is a beloved animated film produced by Walt Disney Animation Studios and released in 2010. Loosely based on the classic fairy tale *Rapunzel* by the Brothers Grimm, *Tangled* reimagines the story with a fresh, modern twist, blending fairy tale magic with action, humor, and heartfelt emotion. The film follows Rapunzel, a young girl with magical, long golden hair that has the power to heal and reverse aging. She has spent her entire life locked away in a hidden tower by the manipulative Mother Gothel, who pretends to love her but actually keeps Rapunzel captive to use her hair’s magic for herself.

Rapunzel’s life changes forever when she meets Flynn Rider, a charming and roguish thief on the run. When Flynn stumbles upon her tower while hiding from the palace guards, Rapunzel seizes the chance to leave her tower and explore the outside world for the first time. She makes a deal with Flynn to guide her to the kingdom’s lantern festival—an event held every year on her birthday by the king and queen, who are unknowingly her real parents, mourning her disappearance. Along their journey, Rapunzel and Flynn face danger, form unlikely friendships, and begin to fall in love, all while discovering who they truly are and what they mean to each other.

*Tangled* is more than just a fairy tale—it’s a story of freedom, self-discovery, and inner strength. Rapunzel, voiced by Mandy Moore, is portrayed as curious, kind, and incredibly brave. She transforms from a sheltered girl into a confident young woman who takes control of her destiny. Flynn Rider, voiced by Zachary Levi, starts off selfish and sarcastic but becomes a loyal and selfless companion. Their evolving relationship is one of the most heartfelt aspects of the film. The movie also features memorable side characters like Pascal the chameleon and Maximus the horse, who add humor and charm.

The animation in *Tangled* is stunning, combining traditional hand-drawn aesthetics with cutting-edge computer animation. The scene with thousands of floating lanterns is particularly iconic, both visually and emotionally, capturing the wonder and beauty of Rapunzel’s dream coming true. The film’s soundtrack, composed by Alan Menken with lyrics by Glenn Slater, includes catchy and emotional songs like *When Will My Life Begin*, *I See the Light*, and *Mother Knows Best*, which became instant classics.

Overall, *Tangled* is a magical film that balances adventure, romance, and comedy with a strong emotional core. It marked a new era for Disney animation, blending the studio’s traditional storytelling charm with modern flair. Rapunzel’s story resonates with audiences of all ages because it's about stepping out of comfort zones, chasing dreams, and discovering the truth about who you are. Whether you watch it for its gorgeous visuals, lovable characters, or inspiring message, *Tangled* is a movie that continues to capture hearts around the world.
