    <h1>SPACE</h1>
    <p>Space, or outer space, is the vast, nearly empty area beyond Earth's atmosphere. 
        It's a vacuum, meaning there's no air, and therefore no sound. 
        Space is characterized by its darkness, as there's no air to scatter sunlight. 
        While often perceived as completely empty, space contains dust and gas, radiation, and even scattered particles of matter. </p>
